class Compose(Randomizable, InvertibleTransform):
    """
    ``Compose`` provides the ability to chain a series of callables together in
    a sequential manner. Each transform in the sequence must take a single
    argument and return a single value.

    ``Compose`` can be used in two ways:

    #. With a series of transforms that accept and return a single
       ndarray / tensor / tensor-like parameter.
    #. With a series of transforms that accept and return a dictionary that
       contains one or more parameters. Such transforms must have pass-through
       semantics that unused values in the dictionary must be copied to the return
       dictionary. It is required that the dictionary is copied between input
       and output of each transform.

    If some transform takes a data item dictionary as input, and returns a
    sequence of data items in the transform chain, all following transforms
    will be applied to each item of this list if `map_items` is `True` (the
    default).  If `map_items` is `False`, the returned sequence is passed whole
    to the next callable in the chain.

    For example:

    A `Compose([transformA, transformB, transformC],
    map_items=True)(data_dict)` could achieve the following patch-based
    transformation on the `data_dict` input:

    #. transformA normalizes the intensity of 'img' field in the `data_dict`.
    #. transformB crops out image patches from the 'img' and 'seg' of
       `data_dict`, and return a list of three patch samples::

        {'img': 3x100x100 data, 'seg': 1x100x100 data, 'shape': (100, 100)}
                             applying transformB
                                 ---------->
        [{'img': 3x20x20 data, 'seg': 1x20x20 data, 'shape': (20, 20)},
         {'img': 3x20x20 data, 'seg': 1x20x20 data, 'shape': (20, 20)},
         {'img': 3x20x20 data, 'seg': 1x20x20 data, 'shape': (20, 20)},]

    #. transformC then randomly rotates or flips 'img' and 'seg' of
       each dictionary item in the list returned by transformB.

    The composed transforms will be set the same global random seed if user called
    `set_determinism()`.

    When using the pass-through dictionary operation, you can make use of
    :class:`monai.transforms.adaptors.adaptor` to wrap transforms that don't conform
    to the requirements. This approach allows you to use transforms from
    otherwise incompatible libraries with minimal additional work.

    Note:

        In many cases, Compose is not the best way to create pre-processing
        pipelines. Pre-processing is often not a strictly sequential series of
        operations, and much of the complexity arises when a not-sequential
        set of functions must be called as if it were a sequence.

        Example: images and labels
        Images typically require some kind of normalization that labels do not.
        Both are then typically augmented through the use of random rotations,
        flips, and deformations.
        Compose can be used with a series of transforms that take a dictionary
        that contains 'image' and 'label' entries. This might require wrapping
        `torchvision` transforms before passing them to compose.
        Alternatively, one can create a class with a `__call__` function that
        calls your pre-processing functions taking into account that not all of
        them are called on the labels.

    Args:
        transforms: sequence of callables.
        map_items: whether to apply transform to each item in the input `data` if `data` is a list or tuple.
            defaults to `True`.
        unpack_items: whether to unpack input `data` with `*` as parameters for the callable function of transform.
            defaults to `False`.
        log_stats: whether to log the detailed information of data and applied transform when error happened,
            for NumPy array and PyTorch Tensor, log the data shape and value range,
            for other metadata, log the values directly. default to `False`.
        lazy_resample: whether to compute consecutive spatial transforms resampling lazily. Default to False.
        mode: {``"bilinear"``, ``"nearest"``}
            Interpolation mode when ``lazy_resample=True``. Defaults to ``"bilinear"``.
            See also: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.grid_sample.html
            When `USE_COMPILED` is `True`, this argument uses
            ``"nearest"``, ``"bilinear"``, ``"bicubic"`` to indicate 0, 1, 3 order interpolations.
            See also: https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/networks.html#grid-pull
        padding_mode: {``"zeros"``, ``"border"``, ``"reflection"``}
            Padding mode for outside grid values when ``lazy_resample=True``. Defaults to ``"border"``.
